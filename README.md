Use R code to generate multiple barplots from Qualtrics data.  This working example consists of data from a sample Qualtrics survey that use the Qualtrics testing function to generate sample Qualtrics survey responses.  

The data were saved as both CSV and SPSS because necessary data do not existin in a single exportable file.  Qualtrics exports data in SPSS format contains labeled data.  When combined with the {haven} package and other {tidyverse} packages and techniques, the steps to visualize become easier by converting labeled data into categorical data.  The CSV file contains the original question text.
